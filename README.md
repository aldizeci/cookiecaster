![Lines](https://img.shields.io/badge/lines-42.21%25-red.svg?style=flat) [![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/fhnw-makerverse/cookiecaster/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fhnw-makerverse/cookiecaster/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)  

CookieCaster 3.0 is a freely available web application that allows users to draw their own personalized cookie cutters in order to print them later with a 3D printer. It provides validation of the cutter shape and recommends suitable print values (such as wall thickness and height) to prevent designs that would be unsuitable or unstable for 3D printing.
