**! STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION !**

CookieCaster 3.0 is a freely available web application that allows users to draw their own personalized cookie cutters in order to print them later with a 3D printer. It provides validation of the cutter shape and recommends suitable print values (such as wall thickness and height) to prevent designs that would be unsuitable or unstable for 3D printing.

## GitHub Pages

The initial setup of GitHub Pages is complete, and the React app is now accessible at https://fhnw-makerverse.github.io/cookiecaster/.
